Corner Grocer Program
Summary
This C++ program, named "Corner Grocer," solves the problem of analyzing a text file containing a list of purchased grocery items. It reads the file, counts the frequency of each item, and provides the user with several ways to view this data. The program allows users to look up the frequency of a specific item, print a list of all items and their frequencies, and display a histogram visualizing the item frequencies. This helps to understand the purchasing patterns of their customers or the contents of a transaction log.
What I Did Particularly Well
I believe I implemented the core functionality of counting word frequencies and presenting it in different formats effectively. The functions correctly read the input file, convert words to lowercase, remove punctuation, and accurately count the occurrences of each item. The input validation in the function handles potential errors if the user enters non-text input. Furthermore, the clear separation of concerns into distinct functions makes the code organized and easier to understand.
Where Could I Enhance My Code?
There are several areas where the code could be enhanced: Error Handling for File Operations, More Sophisticated Input Cleaning. The current punctuation removal is basic. The program could be enhanced to handle more complex scenarios, such as words connected by hyphens (apple-juice) or items with internal spaces (which are currently treated as separate items). Using regular expressions could provide a more flexible and powerful way to clean the input. Sorting the Output: the frequency list and histogram are currently printed in the order the items appear in the map. Allowing the user to sort the output by frequency or alphabetically could improve readability and analysis. These improvements would generally make the code more flexible by handling more input formats and offering case sensitivity.
Which Pieces of the Code Did You Find Most Challenging to Write, and How Did You Overcome This? What Tools or Resources Are You Adding to Your Support Network?
The challenging aspect was correctly using the <algorithm> library for transforming the case and removing punctuation. I had to refer to the C++ documentation and examples on Stack Overflow to ensure I was using transform and remove_if with the correct iterators and predicate functions (::tolower and ::ispunct).
To further enhance my skills and support network, I plan to: deepen my understanding of the C++ Standard Library, engage with online C++ communities (platforms like codewars.com), and review more C++ code examples.
What Skills From This Project Will Be Particularly Transferable to Other Projects or Course Work?
Several skills developed in this project are highly transferable, like file input/output for data analysis to configuration, data structures (maps), string manipulation, input validation, functions design, and basic algorithm usage.
